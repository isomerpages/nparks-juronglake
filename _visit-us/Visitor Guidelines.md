<li>
<p>The use of picnic mats within common shared spaces such as shelters, pavilions
and sun shades is discouraged as it creates an exclusivity setting and
thus a disamenity to other visitors. Visitors are encouraged to picnic
at open lawn areas around Jurong Lake or open fields such as Lakeside Green,
Lakeside Field, Butterfly Field or The Oval.</p>

<p>Except for people with disabilities, Cycling, Riding and PMDs are not
