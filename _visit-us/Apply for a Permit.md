<summary><strong>Research Permits</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>The National Parks Board recognises the importance of research in increasing
the level of knowledge of Singapore’s wildlife. Scientific research provides
crucial information needed for strategic planning, management, decision-making,
identification of information gaps and basis for establishing programmes
for long-term ecological monitoring and sustainability of biological diversity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To facilitate research, permits are issued by NParks. In addition, NParks
will assess whether the research involves activities which require approvals
under the Parks and Trees Act (“PTA”), Parks and Trees Regulations (“PTR”)
or the Wildlife Act (“WA”), and where appropriate, consider granting the
relevant approvals together with the research permit.&nbsp;</p>
