<h3>Cycling Trails</h3>
<p>Cycle along the Park Connector Network and Coast to Coast Trail while
enjoying the sights and sounds of nature.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><u><br>Park Connector Network - Round Island Route</u></strong>
</p>
<p>The Round Island Route (RIR) is a continuous 150 km park connector that
goes around Singapore. The RIR complements existing park connectors – connecting
natural, culture, historical and recreational sites – and bringing communities
closer together.</p>
<p>The main path in Lakeside Garden at Jurong Lake Gardens will be part of
the RIR, providing a link between the west side of Singapore and its southern
end.</p>
<p>Find out more about the RIR at the NParks&nbsp;<a href="http://www.nparks.gov.sg/gardens-parks-and-nature/park-connector-network#RIR" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">website</a>.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><u>Coast to Coast (C2C) Trail</u></strong>
</p>
<p>The C2C Trail stretches 36 km, extending from Jurong Lake Gardens to Coney
Island Park. The trail passes through parks and nature areas such as Bukit
Batok Nature Park and Bishan-Ang Mo Kio Park.</p>
<p>Visitors will find a variety of in-app and onsite activities to keep them
busy while exploring the trail.&nbsp;Find out more about the trail on the
Coast to Coast app and at the NParks&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nparks.gov.sg/c2c" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">website</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><u>Cycling within the Gardens</u></strong>
</p>
<p>There are popular attractions within Jurong Lake Gardens with high visitorship
and we are mindful to maintain a conducive garden ambience for visitors
to enjoy attractions, horticultural collections, landscape and curations.</p>
<p>As such, cycling, riding and personal mobility devices (PMDs) are not
allowed in some attractions; you may refer to the map <a href="/files/Maps and Trails/JLG_No_Cycling_Zones.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">here</a> for
more information.</p>
<p>Wheelchairs and Personal Mobility Aids (PMA) are allowed in throughout
the Gardens to ensure accessibility for those with mobility challenges.</p>
