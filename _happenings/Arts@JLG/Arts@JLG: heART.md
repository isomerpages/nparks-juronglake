<p>Learn from our aspiring chefs as they show you how to make Pinakbet, a
hearty, colourful Filipino vegetable stew. We will be cooking with freshly
harvested squash, eggplant, okra, and long beans, all simmered in a rich,
savoury broth flavoured with fermented shrimp paste (called bagoong). It’s
a dish full of bold flavours and cultural tradition!</p>
