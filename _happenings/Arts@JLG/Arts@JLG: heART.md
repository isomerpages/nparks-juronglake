<p><strong>First Stop: The Philippines!</strong>
</p>
<p>Get ready to kick off our Around the World series with a delicious adventure!</p>
<p>We’ll start the day with a stroll through the Kitchen Garden, where you’ll
discover some unique and tasty vegetables that are staples in Filipino
cooking.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Learn from our aspiring chefs as they show you how to make Pinakbet, a
hearty, colourful Filipino vegetable stew. We will be cooking with freshly
harvested squash, eggplant, okra, and long beans, all simmered in a rich,
savoury broth flavoured with fermented shrimp paste (called bagoong). It’s
a dish full of bold flavours and cultural tradition!</p>
