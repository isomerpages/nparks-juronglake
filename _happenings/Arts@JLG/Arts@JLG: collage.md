<summary>Botanical Art Worldwide by Botanical Art Society Singapore</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>📍Entrance Pavilion, Lakeside Garden</p>
<p>In celebration of the theme of Crop Diversity and its significance in
cultural and agricultural history, this exhibition was first shown at the
Botanical Art Gallery, Singapore Botanic Gardens in May-November 2025 during
Botanical Art Worldwide 2025.
<br>
<br>Members of the Botanical Art Society (Singapore) have submitted botanical
artworks exploring Heritage Crops—traditional plant cultivars not used
in modern, large-scale monocultural agriculture; Crop Wild Relatives—wild
species that can enhance cultivated crops or are foraged wild plants; and
Ancient Crops— plants cultivated for centuries in their original form.
Each piece has been carefully selected by a panel of expert botanists and
botanical artists based on scientific accuracy, artistic merit, technical
mastery, and overall impact.
<br>
<br>Many of these plants hold deep personal meaning for the artists, evoking
memories of home, family traditions, and cultural heritage. Some recall
the familiar ingredients used in home cooking, while others are tied to
crops central to traditional festivities.
<br>
<br>Beyond their personal significance, these plants are valued for their
roles in food, medicine, and textiles, representing a rich genetic diversity
often overlooked in modern agriculture. By showcasing these lesser-known
varieties, this exhibition underscores the importance of preserving plant
biodiversity while celebrating the artistry of botanical illustration.</p>

<summary><em>Next Stop: Together!</em>&nbsp;Art Bus by ART:DIS</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>📅⏰: 3 Sessions;</p>
<p>26 Jan (Mon), 430pm – 730pm |</p>
<p>30 Jan (Fri), 11:30 am – 12:30 pm |</p>
<p>31 Jan, 10am – 1230pm
<br>📍: Wave Plaza, Lakeside Garden</p>
<p>Next Stop: Together! is presented in partnership with the National Arts
Council (NAC), LTA, SMRT, and ART:DIS. The initiative activates Singapore’s
transport system as an artistic platform, where the Art Bus will feature
interactive artworks and participatory activities, transforming neighbourhood
stops into lively hubs of creative exchange.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Next Stop: Together! celebrates what it means to journey alongside one
another in Singapore’s everyday spaces of movement and possibility. At
the heart of the project lies a question: what does it mean to arrive together?
Artists with disabilities and contemporary peers explore this not as separate
journeys, but as intersecting paths that reveal togetherness as both destination
and delightful way of traveling.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The Art Bus is conceived as a tactile and interactive platform, transforming
a mobile training bus into a space where artworks are encountered through
touch, movement, sound, and play. The commissions draw on a wide range
of artistic practices, encompassing image-making, spatial interventions,
embodied sculptural methods, therapeutic processes, and tactile printmaking.
Together, they create an environment that engages multiple senses, offering
points of entry for different modes of perception. This approach underscores
the accessible nature of the project: whether through touch, sight, or
gesture, there is something for everyone to experience, including individuals
with disabilities. At each stop, the Bus becomes a lively, inclusive site
of encounter, lowering barriers to art by making it participatory, sensory,
and rooted in shared experience.</p>
