<p><strong>Arts@JLG: collage</strong> is a programme held from 22 to 31 January
2026, as part of Singapore Art Week. It transforms Jurong Lake Gardens
into an open-air gallery where visual arts flourish through community participation.
Set amidst natural landscapes, the event invites visitors of all ages to
explore the connection between art and nature in an open, interactive environment.</p>
<p>The 2026 edition is themed <strong>"Heritage in Motion: Art Without Boundaries"</strong>.
It explores how heritage and artistic traditions remain vibrant and relevant
when they connect with contemporary communities. Through art installations
and interactive and participative elements, the event breaks down boundaries
across multiple dimensions:</p>

abilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Social</strong>&nbsp;- participatory activities welcoming everyone</p>
