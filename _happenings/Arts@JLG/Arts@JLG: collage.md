<p><strong>Arts@JLG: collage</strong> is a programme held from 19 January
- 1 February 2026, as part of Singapore Art Week. It transforms Jurong
Lake Gardens into an open-air gallery where visual arts flourish through
community participation. Set amidst natural landscapes, the event invites
visitors of all ages to explore the connection between art and nature in
an open, interactive environment.</p>
<p>The 2026 edition is themed <strong>"Heritage in Motion: Art Without Boundaries"</strong>.
It explores how heritage and artistic traditions remain vibrant and relevant
when they connect with contemporary communities. Through art installations
and interactive and participative elements, the event breaks down boundaries
across multiple dimensions:</p>
