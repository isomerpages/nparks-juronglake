<h2>Where Art Meets Nature</h2>
<p>As part of Singapore Art Week, Arts@JLG: collage transforms a section
in Jurong Lake Gardens into a vibrant art and community space where creativity
and nature meet.</p>
<p>This programme invites visitors to explore the intersections between natural
landscapes and artistic expression through a series of installations, interactive
elements, and hands-on workshops.</p>
<p>Look forward to engaging activities over the weekends, including art workshops
designed for all ages. Whether you're a curious passerby or an art enthusiast,
there's something for everyone to enjoy in this unique celebration of art
in the heart of nature.</p>
