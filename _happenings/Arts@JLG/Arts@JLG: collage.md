Lake Gardens into an open-air gallery where visual arts flourish through

<summary>Botanical Art Worldwide by Botanical Art Society Singapore</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>📍Entrance Pavilion, Lakeside Garden</p>
<p>In celebration of the theme of Crop Diversity and its significance in
cultural and agricultural history, this exhibition was first shown at the
Botanical Art Gallery, Singapore Botanic Gardens in May-November 2025 during
Botanical Art Worldwide 2025.
<br>
<br>Members of the Botanical Art Society (Singapore) have submitted botanical
artworks exploring Heritage Crops—traditional plant cultivars not used
in modern, large-scale monocultural agriculture; Crop Wild Relatives—wild
species that can enhance cultivated crops or are foraged wild plants; and
Ancient Crops— plants cultivated for centuries in their original form.
Each piece has been carefully selected by a panel of expert botanists and
botanical artists based on scientific accuracy, artistic merit, technical
mastery, and overall impact.
<br>
<br>Many of these plants hold deep personal meaning for the artists, evoking
memories of home, family traditions, and cultural heritage. Some recall
the familiar ingredients used in home cooking, while others are tied to
crops central to traditional festivities.
<br>
<br>Beyond their personal significance, these plants are valued for their
roles in food, medicine, and textiles, representing a rich genetic diversity
often overlooked in modern agriculture. By showcasing these lesser-known
varieties, this exhibition underscores the importance of preserving plant
biodiversity while celebrating the artistry of botanical illustration.</p>
