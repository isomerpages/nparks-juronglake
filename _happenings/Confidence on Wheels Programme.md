<h2>About the Programme</h2>
<p>The Land Transport Authority (LTA)'s Confidence on Wheels (CW) programme
educates participants on the proper use of active mobility infrastructure
and practical safe riding skills. The programme covers the rules and code
of conduct governing the use of active mobility devices in Singapore whilst
providing practical riding skills to instil confidence and foster safe
riding habits.</p>
<p>This 45-minute programme is designed for users of active mobility devices
aged 16 and above. LTA also offers tailored CW sessions to schools for
students, with content adapted to various school levels.</p>
<h2>What's Covered</h2>
<p>The CW programme for active mobility device users includes comprehensive
training across three key areas. Participants will learn about key active
mobility rules and code of conduct that govern safe riding in Singapore.
The programme features a skill-based practical session where participants
test their knowledge and safe riding skills through five activity stations:
S-course, straight course, avoiding overhead obstacles, balancing, and
emergency brake. Additionally, scenario-based discussions help test participants'
understanding of active mobility rules and code of conduct in real-world
situations.</p>
<h2>Programme Details</h2>
<p><strong>Date</strong>: <strong>7 December 2025 (Sunday)</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Time: 9:30AM to 12:00PM</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Venue: Jurong Lake Gardens, Banyan Hall (Gardenhouse)</strong>
</p>
<p>Each CW session runs for approximately 45 minutes and is conducted in
English. The LTA-appointed training provider can conduct the programme
in Mandarin upon request to accommodate different language preferences.</p>
<h2>Who Should Attend</h2>
<p>The CW programme is specifically designed for existing cyclists and users
of personal mobility devices (PMDs) who ride on public paths and roads.
It's ideal for those who want to enhance their riding skills and ensure
they're following proper safety protocols.</p>
<h2>Participation Requirements</h2>
<p>All participants attending sessions organised by Grassroots Organisations
(GROs) or Active Mobility Community Ambassador (AMCA) teams must meet specific
criteria. Participants must be at least 16 years old and possess basic
bicycle handling and riding skills.</p>
<p>LTA works with schools of all levels to organise CW sessions for students.
Since CW is fully subsidised by the government, participants are only allowed
to attend once to ensure no repeated subsidies are made. For this reason,
CW sessions for members of the public outside of schools do not accept
individuals below 16 years of age. Participants will be required to provide
their full NRIC or FIN for LTA's verification.</p>
<h2>Cost and Certification</h2>
<p>The CW programme is completely free for participants who have not previously
attended. Upon completion of the session, participants will receive a digital
certificate sent to their email address. The certificate includes details
such as the participant's name and the date they attended the session,
serving as official recognition of their completion of the programme.</p>
