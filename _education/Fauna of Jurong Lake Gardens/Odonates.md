<p>Damselflies and dragonflies belong to the order <strong>Odonata</strong> and
are known collectively as odonates. Adult odonates have many adaptations
that make them great fliers and fierce predators of smaller insects, including
other odonates, such as:</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Large, well-developed compound eyes adept at tracking small movements;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Two pairs of transparent wings attached at the thorax that can move independently
of each other, allowing them to move in many directions when flying; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Legs which have adapted to form a basket to catch prey.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>They are also, in turn, important food sources for predators such as birds,
spiders and frogs.</p>
<p>Odonates start their life in water. Even when young, odonate larvae, called
nymphs, are fierce predators of small prey like fish and other aquatic
invertebrates. Damselfly nymphs are slender with 3 gills on their tails,
whereas dragonfly nymphs are short and thick, with gills inside their abdomens.
They moult (shed their exoskeleton) 8 to 15 times before leaving the water
to become adults.</p>
<p>Habitat enhancement efforts include incorporating spaces such as Neram
Streams, a naturalised drainage system leading to Jurong Lake, in our parks
and gardens. As the streams are a suitable habitat for the nymphs, many
species of odonates can be seen in Jurong Lake Gardens.&nbsp;Click below
