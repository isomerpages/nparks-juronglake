<p>Mammals are warm-blooded and often have hair on their bodies. They also
produce milk to feed their young. The name “mammal” comes from the word
“mammary” which is the gland that produces milk!</p>
<p>Mammals can be classified into 3 types based on how their babies develop:</p>
<p><strong>Monotremes</strong>
</p>
<p>These are mammals that lay eggs! The eggs hatch after 10-11 days and the
babies are tiny, about the size of a 10-cent coin. They feed on their mothers’
milk in pouches on the mothers’ bellies. The only Monotremes alive today
are the Spiny Anteater and Platypus in Australia (including Tasmania) and
New Guinea.</p>
<p><strong>Marsupials</strong>
</p>
<p>Marsupials give birth to babies that are tiny and not fully developed.
They crawl up their mothers’ fur into the pouches on the mothers’ bellies
and drink their mothers’ milk until they fully develop. These species include
koalas, kangaroos, wallabies, wombats and opossums that are found mostly
in Australia, New Guinea and South America.</p>
<p><strong>Placentals</strong>
</p>
<p>Most mammals fall in this group, including us humans! The babies are carried
in the uterus of the mothers to a late stage of development before they
are born. Like marsupials, pregnant mother placentals have a placenta,
which exchanges nutrients and waste materials between the baby in the womb
and the mother.</p>
