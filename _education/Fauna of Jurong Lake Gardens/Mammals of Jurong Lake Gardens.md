<p>Mammals are warm-blooded and often have hair on their bodies. They also
produce milk to feed their young. The name “mammal” comes from the word
“mammary” which is the gland that produces milk!</p>
<p>Mammals can be classified into 3 types based on how their babies develop:</p>
<p><strong>Monotremes</strong>
</p>
<p>These are mammals that lay eggs! The eggs hatch after 10-11 days and the
babies are tiny, about the size of a 10-cent coin. They feed on their mothers’
milk in pouches on the mothers’ bellies. The only Monotremes alive today
are the Spiny Anteater and Platypus in Australia (including Tasmania) and
New Guinea.</p>
<p><strong>Marsupials</strong>
</p>
<p>Marsupials give birth to babies that are tiny and not fully developed.
They crawl up their mothers’ fur into the pouches on the mothers’ bellies
and drink their mothers’ milk until they fully develop. These species include
koalas, kangaroos, wallabies, wombats and opossums that are found mostly
in Australia, New Guinea and South America.</p>
<p><strong>Placentals</strong>
</p>
<p>Most mammals fall in this group, including us humans! The babies are carried
in the uterus of the mothers to a late stage of development before they
are born. Like marsupials, pregnant mother placentals have a placenta,
which exchanges nutrients and waste materials between the baby in the womb
and the mother.</p>

<p><strong>What does it look like?</strong>
</p>
<p>Plantain Squirrels are one of the most common native mammals in Singapore,
alongside the Long-tailed Macaque. They have an orange belly with black
and white stripes on their sides, which differentiates them from the less
common Slender Squirrel.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Ecology, Habitat and Distribution</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Diet and Behaviour</strong>
</p>
<p>They mainly eat fruits and leaves, but will jump at the chance to have
insects and bird eggs when available. They communicate via tail movements
and vocalisations such as mating calls or anti-predator alerts, which are
often mistaken for bird calls. They have different calls for different
predators.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Where are they found?</strong>
</p>
<p>They are common residents of our parks, gardens, mangroves and secondary
forests. They are important seed dispersers in our forests and also serve
as a food source for predators such as snakes and eagles.&nbsp;Their range
stretches from southern Thailand across the Malay Peninsula to the islands
of Borneo, Java and Sumatra.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Did you know?</strong>
</p>
<p>There are two other native species of non-flying squirrels in Singapore:
the Slender Squirrel and the Shrew-faced Ground Squirrel.</p>

<p><strong>What does it look like?</strong>
</p>
<p>Named after its short, smooth and sleek fur, Smooth-coated Otters are
the larger of two otter species found in Singapore (the other being the
Asian Small-clawed Otter, <em>Aonyx cinerea</em>), growing up to 1.2 m in
body length.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Its upperparts are greyish brown and its undersides are yellowish beige.
It has a streamlined body adapted for swimming and fully webbed feet with
prominent claws for catching prey.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Ecology, Habitat and Distribution</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Diet and Behaviour</strong>
</p>
<p>The<strong> </strong>Smooth-coated Otter’s main diet is fish, such as
tilapia and catfish, but they also feed on frogs, crabs, birds and small
rodents.</p>
<p></p>
<p>They are highly social animals that form family groups consisting of a
monogamous mating pair and their pups. They have the potential to breed
year-round, provided food and suitable habitats are available. While baby
otters look extremely adorable, it is best to admire them from a distance
as the mothers are very protective of their young, like all other wild
animals.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Pups are born blind in hidden burrows and open their eyes after 10 days.
They are taught to forage and swim in a few months and will stay with their
parents for at least a year. Their average lifespan is about 10 years.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Where are they found?</strong>
</p>
<p>Being semi-aquatic, they require both terrestrial and aquatic (usually
freshwater) habitats to survive. Successful efforts in cleaning up our
waterways have expanded their range from coastal mangroves to rivers, reservoirs
and urban spaces on land.</p>
<p></p>
<p>They can regularly be seen at Marina Bay, Pasir Ris Park, Sungei Buloh
Wetland Reserve and Jurong Lake Gardens.&nbsp;Smooth-coated Otters are
widely distributed in Pakistan, India, south China, the Malay Peninsula,
Sumatra, Borneo and Java.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Did you know?</strong>
</p>
<p>A family of about 15-16 otters frequents the waters of Jurong Lake Gardens.
Otters are territorial between groups and will defend their space by marking
areas on land with their spraint (otter poop, characterised by a distinct
fishy smell and greenish brown jelly-like appearance).</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Conservation Status</strong>
</p>
<p>It is listed as Critically Endangered in the Singapore Red Data Book (2008).
Threats that the otters face in Singapore include car traffic in urban
areas and interactions with humans.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Additionally,&nbsp;It is a protected species in many countries, being
listed as Vulnerable by the IUCN and offered the highest protection level
in international trade by being up listed to CITES Appendix I.</p>

<p><strong>What does it look like?</strong>
</p>
<p>The Common Fruit Bat has a dog-like face with a long muzzle and large
eyes. It is about 7 cm from head to feet, making it one of the largest
bat species in Singapore. It is brown in colour and has a reddish (male)
or yellowish (female) collar. Their ears and wing bones have distinct white
edges.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Ecology, Habitat and Distribution</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Diet and Behaviour</strong>
</p>
<p>These nocturnal creatures feed on nectar and fruits. They tend to roost
in small groups in shaded areas during the day.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Where are they found?</strong>
</p>
<p>They are found in both forest and urban habitats, in buildings, trees,
palms and under leaves (e.g. banana leaves) during the day. They are widespread
and common in Singapore.</p>
<p></p>
<p>They are distributed in Sri Lanka, Myanmar, South China, Indochina, the
Philippines, Malaysia and western Indonesia.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Did you know?</strong>
</p>
<p>Bats are divided into two main groups, megabats and microbats. Common
Fruit Bats are megabats which are mainly fruit and nectar feeders. Microbats
are much smaller in size and eat mostly insects and other small animals.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Bats are specially adapted to navigate using sound with a technique called
echolocation. They emit ultrasonic sound waves from their mouths or noses
which bounce off objects and prey as echoes, indicating their location.
However, the Common Fruit Bat’s echolocation abilities are limited and
it mainly uses vision and scent to locate food sources.</p>
