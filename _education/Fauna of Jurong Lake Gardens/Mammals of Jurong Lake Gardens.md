<p>Mammals are warm-blooded and often have hair on their bodies. They also
produce milk to feed their young. The name “mammal” comes from the word
“mammary” which is the gland that produces milk!</p>
<p>Mammals can be classified into 3 types based on how their babies develop:</p>
<p><strong>Monotremes</strong>
</p>
<p>These are mammals that lay eggs! The eggs hatch after 10-11 days and the
babies are tiny, about the size of a 10-cent coin. They feed on their mothers’
milk in pouches on the mothers’ bellies. The only Monotremes alive today
are the Spiny Anteater and Platypus in Australia (including Tasmania) and
New Guinea.</p>
<p><strong>Marsupials</strong>
</p>
<p>Marsupials give birth to babies that are tiny and not fully developed.
They crawl up their mothers’ fur into the pouches on the mothers’ bellies
and drink their mothers’ milk until they fully develop. These species include
koalas, kangaroos, wallabies, wombats and opossums that are found mostly
in Australia, New Guinea and South America.</p>
<p><strong>Placentals</strong>
</p>
<p>Most mammals fall in this group, including us humans! The babies are carried
in the uterus of the mothers to a late stage of development before they
are born. Like marsupials, pregnant mother placentals have a placenta,
which exchanges nutrients and waste materials between the baby in the womb
and the mother.</p>

<p><strong>What does it look like?</strong>
</p>
<p>Plantain Squirrels are one of the most common native mammals in Singapore,
alongside the Long-tailed Macaque. They have an orange belly with black
and white stripes on their sides, which differentiates them from the less
common Slender Squirrel.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Ecology, Habitat and Distribution</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Diet and Behaviour</strong>
</p>
<p>They mainly eat fruits and leaves, but will jump at the chance to have
insects and bird eggs when available. They communicate via tail movements
and vocalisations such as mating calls or anti-predator alerts, which are
often mistaken for bird calls. They have different calls for different
predators.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Where are they found?</strong>
</p>
<p>They are common residents of our parks, gardens, mangroves and secondary
forests. They are important seed dispersers in our forests and also serve
as a food source for predators such as snakes and eagles.&nbsp;Their range
stretches from southern Thailand across the Malay Peninsula to the islands
of Borneo, Java and Sumatra.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Did you know?</strong>
</p>
<p>There are two other native species of non-flying squirrels in Singapore:
the Slender Squirrel and the Shrew-faced Ground Squirrel.</p>
