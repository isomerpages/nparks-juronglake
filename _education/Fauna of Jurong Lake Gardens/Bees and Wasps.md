</p>
<p><strong>What are they?</strong>
</p>
<p>Bees and wasps (together with ants) form the large insect order <strong>Hymenoptera</strong>.
Many species have a constriction between their thorax and abdomen, giving
the appearance of a prominent ‘waist’. Females also have a stinger with
glands that secrete venom, which is in fact a modified ovipositor (an organ
used to lay eggs). This is why only female bees and wasps can sting!</p>
<p><strong>Why are they important?</strong>
</p>
<p>Bees and wasps play important roles in our forests, parks and gardens.
Bees are important pollinators – animals that transport pollen from the
male flower to the female flower. Without them, many plants would not be
able to develop fruits and seeds. Meanwhile, wasps function as predators
of other small insects, keeping their populations in check.</p>
<p><strong>Are they dangerous?</strong>
</p>
<p>It is safe to view bees and wasps while they’re at flowers, as they will
only get aggressive when their nests are threatened. Their presence is
a welcome sight as many of the plants in our parks and garden rely on them
to reproduce, in turn providing food for other organisms. They also increase
the fruit yield of many popular edible plants such as brinjals and gourds.</p>
<p>Here are some of the bees and wasps that you can see in Jurong Lake Gardens.</p>
<h2><strong>Honey Bees</strong></h2>
<p>Honey bees are highly social bees of the genus <em>Apis</em>. They are
native to Eurasia and Africa but certain species have been distributed
worldwide (except Antarctica) by people for honey production. They are
known for their complex social systems and nests, which are combs made
from wax.</p>
<p>Their primary diet is nectar and pollen. They are generalist pollinators
that visit a wide range of flowers with easily accessible pollen and nectar.
Usually, an individual scout bee searches for flowers using a combination
of sight and smell. It then communicates its location to others by doing
a dance. By rapidly recruiting its sister worker bees, it can efficiently
collect large amounts of pollen.</p>
<p>Caution should be taken when a hive is found as honey bees will readily
sting to protect their home when threatened or disturbed. However, they
are docile and safe when foraging away from their nest.</p>
<p>Four species of honey bees are found in Singapore:</p>

<p><strong>What does it look like?</strong>
<br>This species has yellow and brown/black bands. It is smaller than the
Giant Honey Bee and has an additional brown/black band across the abdomen.
It is the most common bee in Singapore.</p>
<p><strong>Behaviour and Ecology</strong>
</p>
<p>They usually build their nests in enclosed areas, such as tree holes.
In urban environments, they might also use upturned pots and roofs. Their
hives consist of multiple wax combs lined parallel to one another.<strong><br></strong>

<p>The largest of the honey bee species found in Singapore, it has one less
brown/black band at the top of the abdomen as compared to the Asian Honey
Bee.</p>
<p><strong>Behaviour and Ecology</strong>
</p>
<p>It is more commonly found in forested areas where it builds its nest hanging
from tree branches. The nests usually consist of a large, open single comb
that may support up to 100,000 workers. It is aggressive when its nest
is provoked, but this has not stopped the indigenous people of Southeast
Asia from collecting the beeswax and honey produced by this species.</p>
<p>Unlike other honey bee species, it can actively forage after dusk and
is often attracted to artificial light sources.<strong><br></strong>

</p>
<p>The smallest of the honey bee species, the Red Dwarf Honey Bee can be
told apart by its reddish orange colouration on the first few segments
of its abdomen as compared to the black colouration of the Black Dwarf
Honey Bee. In addition, the Red Dwarf Honey Bee has a grey thorax while
the Black Dwarf Honey Bee has a brown one.</p>
<p><strong>Behaviour and Ecology</strong>
</p>
<p>These bees are fairly common in our parks and gardens. In contrast to
the Giant Honey Bee, they build their nests lower in vegetation. They apply
a band of sticky plant resin to the twigs supporting their small, single-comb
nest to keep out ants that may try to attack them. They are naturally nomadic,
and will abandon their hive to find a new nesting site within three to
six months.</p>
<p>Dwarf Honey Bees are not regarded as dangerous and aggressive, only attacking
in cases of severe disturbance to their nest. Furthermore, their stings
are inefficient and do not pierce the skin of adults easily.<strong><br></strong>

</p>
<p>Its abdomen is striped with alternating brilliant blue and black bands
and has orange brown hair covering its thorax. Despite its speedy flight,
its vibrant blue bands are easily recognisable.</p>
<p>
<br><strong>Behaviour and Ecology</strong>
</p>
<p>Blue-banded Digger Bees are solitary bees that have the ability to buzz
pollinate flowers. Clinging onto the flower’s anthers, the bee vibrates
its body at a particular frequency that causes pollen from the flower to
be released. They nest in the ground, particularly in clayey soil. In urban
environments, they are known to use man-made surfaces such as mortar between
bricks and concrete as nests instead.</p>
<p>You will rarely ever get stung from this species as they are shy and docile
creatures. Their presence is a welcome sight in our parks and gardens.</p>

<h2><strong>Carpenter Bees</strong></h2>
<p>Carpenter bees from the genus <em>Xylocopa</em> are large and often hairy
bees that are usually dark coloured and about 20-30 mm in length.</p>
<p>True to their name, they create burrows in solid wood, usually dead tree
trunks and branches or timber used for construction. These burrows branch
out into many parallel passageways. Brood cells in their nest are filled
with pollen and deposited with a single egg each. Unlike honey bees, which
live in colonies with a single egg-laying female (the queen), Carpenter
Bees are considered solitary bees which live singly or in small groups.
All females are able to reproduce.</p>
<p>In addition to being large, they also buzz loudly while foraging for nectar
and pollen from many trees and shrubs. Despite this, they are peaceful
giants that are relatively docile and harmless. They carry out buzz pollination,
where they grab onto flowers and buzz at a specific frequency, releasing
pollen in the process. They function as pollinators of many local plants
such as Sendudok (<em>Melastoma malabathricum</em>) and Simpoh Air (<em>Dillenia suffruticosa</em>).</p>
<p>About 13 species of carpenter bees have been recorded in Singapore. Here
are some common species found in Jurong Lake Gardens.<strong><br></strong>

<p>The all-black<em> </em>Broad-footed Carpenter Bee is the largest bee in
Singapore, and also one of the largest in the world. It is shiny and fully
black with metallic blue green or purple wings in sunlight. It has a distinctive,
low-pitched buzzing that can be heard while foraging. Males have unusual
front legs that are lighter in colour and covered in smooth, brush-like
hairs.</p>

<p>The female is mainly black with a thorax covered with deep yellow hairs
except for a small black patch in the centre. The male, in contrast, is
covered with fine yellow hairs, making it look fully dark yellow. They
are named after a small patch of fine white hairs found behind their eyes
in both sexes.</p>
<p>Females are often mistaken for the Yellow-and-black Carpenter Bee (<em>X. flavonigrescens</em>),
though one way to tell them apart is to look at the luminous colours, known
as iridescence, of their wings. Female White-cheeked Carpenter Bees<em> </em>have
a purplish brown iridescence on their wings as compared to the bluish-green
iridescence of the Yellow-and-black Carpenter Bee.</p>

<h2><strong>Megachilid Bees</strong></h2>
<p>These bees are from the family Megachilidae and are solitary or brood
parasites of the nests of other bees, in contrast to the social groups
of honey bees. Their nests come in all forms, ranging from soil and stem
burrows, wood burrows made by beetles, on rocks, to stems and leaves. They
supplement their nests with other materials, which explains their common
names of Leaf-cutter Bees and Resin Bees.</p>

<h2><strong>Wasps and Hornets</strong></h2>
<p>The term wasps usually refer to<strong> </strong>social wasps from the
family Vespidae, but may also refer to other families that share a similar
appearance. Wasps have a slender body form and a distinctive petiole (stalk)
in the middle of their body. Unlike bees, they are unable to produce wax
and instead use mud or chewed up wood pulp to strengthen their nests. They
can also sting multiple times, unlike honey bees.</p>
<p>While they are carnivorous, they supplement their diet with sugar from
ripe fruits, insect honeydew and tree sap. They have stings used to kill
prey such as caterpillars and other smaller insects. When defending their
nests, they can be particularly aggressive.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hornets are from the genus <em>Vespa</em> and are the largest of the eusocial
wasps. They mainly prey on insects like houseflies, caterpillars, grasshoppers
and other smaller bees and wasps. Sometimes, a large group of hornets may
raid a honey bee hive not just for its honey, but also for the bee larvae
and pupae found inside.</p>

<p>In Singapore, Potter Wasps in general can be identified by their particularly
long petioles (waists) and their black and reddish brown colouration in
adults. Both males and females are fully winged.</p>
<p><strong><br>Behaviour and Ecology</strong>
</p>
<p>The Pear-tailed Potter Wasp is a commonly seen wasp species in Singapore
that is well-adapted to both urban and natural habitats.</p>
<p><strong>Nests: </strong>Its nest consists of pot-shaped cells that are
covered with a layer of mud, hence its name. It builds its nest on tree
trunks, branches and on man-made structures. The female lays an egg in
each cell and stores it with a paralysed prey before sealing it with mud.
Once hatched, the wasp larva eats the stored prey.</p>
<p><strong>Behaviour: </strong>Despite its large size, it is relatively harmless
if left alone and is more likely to flee than attack.</p>

</p>
<p>It is a medium-sized wasp that is mostly black with reddish brown on parts
of its thorax and the front of its head. Its most striking feature is its
abdomen that starts with a small dark brown band, followed by a larger
deep yellow band. Its wings are tinged brown at the base. It may be confused
with the Lesser Banded Hornet (<em>Vespa affinis</em>), but is noticeably
more slender.</p>
<p><strong><br>Behaviour and Ecology</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Nests:</strong> Paper wasps build their nests by gathering fibres
from dead wood and plant stems. After mixing them with their saliva, the
paper-like material is applied in layers onto surfaces to create a tough,
water-resistant paper when dried. The nests are attached to surfaces with
a distinct stalk. The combs of the nest are open and are protected by a
chemical secreted by the wasp that repels predators such as ants.</p>
<p><strong>Behaviour:</strong> Paper wasps are generally non-aggressive and
will only attack if threatened. Paper wasps like <em>P. sagittarius</em> prey
almost exclusively on caterpillars, including many pest species. This makes
their presence very beneficial to plant nurseries!</p>

<p><strong>What does it look like?</strong>
</p>
<p>It is a small to medium-sized hornet that is fully black with the first
two abdominal segments forming a brilliant orange band. It can be told
apart from the Banded Paper Wasp by its stouter body.</p>
<p><strong><br>Behaviour and Ecology</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Nests: </strong>Hornets generally have larger colonies than other
wasps and make larger nests made of chewed rotten wood mixed with saliva.
They are built on small trees, bushes and even uncovered sites on buildings.</p>
<p><strong>Behaviour:</strong> The Lesser Banded Hornet colonies are founded
by multiple queens. While they respond aggressively to disturbances of
their nest, they will otherwise not attack unprovoked.</p>

<p><strong>What does it look like?</strong>
</p>
<p>It is a medium to large-sized hornet. The colour of this species varies
based on locality, but in Singapore it is usually black with a distinct
bright orange band on its abdomen. It can be told apart from the Lesser
Banded Hornet (<em>Vespa affinis</em>) by its generally larger size. Its
orange band lies only on the second segment of the abdomen while the band
on the Lesser Banded Hornet also partially covers the first segment.</p>
<p><strong><br>Behaviour and Ecology</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Nests: </strong>Their globular nests may be constructed in various
locations, including underground, in enclosed spaces such as tree hollows,
or high on trees. The surface of the nest is often covered with intricate,
ripple-like patterns.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Behaviour:</strong> &nbsp;Greater Banded Hornets tend to fly high
in trees under the cover of dense foliage. They are known for their raids
on Paper Wasp (<em>Ropalidia</em> spp.) nests, where they will kill the
adults and take the larvae back to feed their own larvae. They may defend
their nest aggressively when provoked so it is important not to disturb
their nests.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
