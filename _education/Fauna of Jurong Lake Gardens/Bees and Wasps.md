<p><strong>What are they?</strong>
</p>
<p>Bees and wasps (together with ants) form the large insect order <strong>Hymenoptera</strong>.
Many species have a constriction between their thorax and abdomen, giving
the appearance of a prominent ‘waist’. Females also have a stinger with
glands that secrete venom, which is in fact a modified ovipositor (an organ
used to lay eggs). This is why only female bees and wasps can sting!</p>
<p><strong>Why are they important?</strong>
</p>
<p>Bees and wasps play important roles in our forests, parks and gardens.
Bees are important pollinators – animals that transport pollen from the
male flower to the female flower. Without them, many plants would not be
able to develop fruits and seeds. Meanwhile, wasps function as predators
of other small insects, keeping their populations in check.</p>
<p><strong>Are they dangerous?</strong>
</p>
<p>It is safe to view bees and wasps while they’re at flowers, as they will
only get aggressive when their nests are threatened. Their presence is
a welcome sight as many of the plants in our parks and garden rely on them
to reproduce, in turn providing food for other organisms. They also increase
the fruit yield of many popular edible plants such as brinjals and gourds.</p>
<p>Here are some of the bees and wasps that you can see in Jurong Lake Gardens.</p>

<p><strong>What does it look like?</strong>
<br>This species has yellow and brown/black bands. It is smaller than the
Giant Honey Bee and has an additional brown/black band across the abdomen.
It is the most common bee in Singapore.</p>
<p><strong>Behaviour and Ecology</strong>
</p>
<p>They usually build their nests in enclosed areas, such as tree holes.
In urban environments, they might also use upturned pots and roofs. Their
hives consist of multiple wax combs lined parallel to one another.<strong><br></strong>

</p>
<p>The largest of the honey bee species found in Singapore, it has one less
brown/black band at the top of the abdomen as compared to the Asian Honey
Bee.</p>
<p><strong>Behaviour and Ecology</strong>
</p>
<p>It is more commonly found in forested areas where it builds its nest hanging
from tree branches. The nests usually consist of a large, open single comb
that may support up to 100,000 workers. It is aggressive when its nest
is provoked, but this has not stopped the indigenous people of Southeast
Asia from collecting the beeswax and honey produced by this species.</p>
<p>Unlike other honey bee species, it can actively forage after dusk and
is often attracted to artificial light sources.<strong><br></strong>

<p><strong>What do they look like?</strong>
</p>
<p>The smallest of the honey bee species, the Red Dwarf Honey Bee can be
told apart by its reddish orange colouration on the first few segments
of its abdomen as compared to the black colouration of the Black Dwarf
Honey Bee. In addition, the Red Dwarf Honey Bee has a grey thorax while
the Black Dwarf Honey Bee has a brown one.</p>
<p><strong>Behaviour and Ecology</strong>
</p>
<p>These bees are fairly common in our parks and gardens. In contrast to
the Giant Honey Bee, they build their nests lower in vegetation. They apply
a band of sticky plant resin to the twigs supporting their small, single-comb
nest to keep out ants that may try to attack them. They are naturally nomadic,
and will abandon their hive to find a new nesting site within three to
six months.</p>
<p>Dwarf Honey Bees are not regarded as dangerous and aggressive, only attacking
in cases of severe disturbance to their nest. Furthermore, their stings
are inefficient and do not pierce the skin of adults easily.<strong><br></strong>

<p><strong>What does it look like?</strong>
</p>
<p>Its abdomen is striped with alternating brilliant blue and black bands
and has orange brown hair covering its thorax. Despite its speedy flight,
its vibrant blue bands are easily recognisable.</p>
<p>
<br><strong>Behaviour and Ecology</strong>
</p>
<p>Blue-banded Digger Bees are solitary bees that have the ability to buzz
pollinate flowers. Clinging onto the flower’s anthers, the bee vibrates
its body at a particular frequency that causes pollen from the flower to
be released. They nest in the ground, particularly in clayey soil. In urban
environments, they are known to use man-made surfaces such as mortar between
bricks and concrete as nests instead.</p>
<p>You will rarely ever get stung from this species as they are shy and docile
creatures. Their presence is a welcome sight in our parks and gardens.</p>

<p>The all-black<em> </em>Broad-footed Carpenter Bee is the largest bee in
Singapore, and also one of the largest in the world. It is shiny and fully
black with metallic blue green or purple wings in sunlight. It has a distinctive,
low-pitched buzzing that can be heard while foraging. Males have unusual
front legs that are lighter in colour and covered in smooth, brush-like
hairs.</p>

<p>The female is mainly black with a thorax covered with deep yellow hairs
except for a small black patch in the centre. The male, in contrast, is
covered with fine yellow hairs, making it look fully dark yellow. They
are named after a small patch of fine white hairs found behind their eyes
in both sexes.</p>
<p>Females are often mistaken for the Yellow-and-black Carpenter Bee (<em>X. flavonigrescens</em>),
though one way to tell them apart is to look at the luminous colours, known
as iridescence, of their wings. Female White-cheeked Carpenter Bees<em> </em>have
a purplish brown iridescence on their wings as compared to the bluish-green
iridescence of the Yellow-and-black Carpenter Bee.</p>

<p>Females are often mistaken for the White-cheeked Carpenter Bee as they
look exceedingly alike, though one way to tell them apart is to look at
the iridescence of their wings. Males are easier to differentiate as their
thorax is a more vibrant yellow that gets progressively darker towards
the end of the abdomen.

<h4><strong>Megachilid Bees</strong></h4>
<p>These bees are from the family Megachilidae and are solitary or brood
parasites of the nests of other bees, in contrast to the social groups
of honey bees. Their nests come in all forms, ranging from soil and stem
burrows, wood burrows made by beetles, on rocks, to stems and leaves. They
supplement their nests with other materials, which explains their common
names of Leaf-cutter Bees and Resin Bees.</p>

<p>Megachilid bees like the Resin Bee have a more rectangular or oblong shape
than other bees. The Disjunct Resin Bee is black with purplish metallic
wings and has a patch of white hairs on the top of its abdomen near the
thorax. It stores its collected pollen on the underside of its abdomen
while foraging, rather than on its hind legs like other bees.</p>

<h4><strong>Wasps and Hornets</strong></h4>
<p>The term wasps usually refer to<strong> </strong>social wasps from the
family Vespidae, but may also refer to other families that share a similar
appearance. Wasps have a slender body form and a distinctive petiole (stalk)
in the middle of their body. Unlike bees, they are unable to produce wax
and instead use mud or chewed up wood pulp to strengthen their nests. They
can also sting multiple times, unlike honey bees.</p>
<p>While they are carnivorous, they supplement their diet with sugar from
ripe fruits, insect honeydew and tree sap. They have stings used to kill
prey such as caterpillars and other smaller insects. When defending their
nests, they can be particularly aggressive.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hornets are from the genus <em>Vespa</em> and are the largest of the eusocial
wasps. They mainly prey on insects like houseflies, caterpillars, grasshoppers
and other smaller bees and wasps. Sometimes, a large group of hornets may
raid a honey bee hive not just for its honey, but also for the bee larvae
and pupae found inside.</p>

</p>
<p>In Singapore, Potter Wasps in general can be identified by their particularly
long petioles (waists) and their black and reddish brown colouration in
adults. Both males and females are fully winged.</p>
<p><strong><br>Behaviour and Ecology</strong>
</p>
<p>The Pear-tailed Potter Wasp is a commonly seen wasp species in Singapore
that is well-adapted to both urban and natural habitats.</p>
<p><strong>Nests: </strong>Its nest consists of pot-shaped cells that are
covered with a layer of mud, hence its name. It builds its nest on tree
trunks, branches and on man-made structures. The female lays an egg in
each cell and stores it with a paralysed prey before sealing it with mud.
Once hatched, the wasp larva eats the stored prey.</p>
<p><strong>Behaviour: </strong>Despite its large size, it is relatively harmless
if left alone and is more likely to flee than attack.</p>
