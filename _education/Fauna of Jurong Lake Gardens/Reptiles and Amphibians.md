<p>Jurong Lake Gardens is home to a number of reptile and amphibian species.
Both reptiles and amphibians are ectotherms, or cold-blooded, and rely
on external sources to maintain their body temperature. You’ll often see
reptiles such as water monitor lizards and terrapins basking in the sun
to warm up.</p>
<p>Reptiles lay eggs with shells on land. Most amphibians, on the other hand,
begin their life as eggs in water that hatch into aquatic larvae (e.g.
tadpoles), which later develop into adults that can survive on land. These
eggs are covered by a transparent jelly-like substance.</p>

<p><strong>What does it look like?</strong>
</p>
<p>It is a large greyish brown lizard with leathery skin and non-overlapping
scales. Its tongue is slender and forked. In Singapore, it is often mistaken
for the Estuarine Crocodile (<em>Crocodylus porosus</em>) and is also a
smaller relative of the Komodo Dragon (<em>Varanus komodoensis</em>). You
can usually spot a few of them roaming around Jurong Lake Gardens.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Behaviour and Ecology</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Diet and Behaviour</strong>
</p>
<p>The Malayan Water Monitor eats fishes, frogs, crabs, birds and other small
animals, and has been known to scavenge on dead animals. It hunts during
the day. This generalist diet allows it to be very adaptable to even highly
disturbed environments.</p>
<p></p>
<p>These reptiles are usually shy, preferring to run from disturbance. It
is advisable to leave them alone as they may become aggressive when cornered.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Where is it found?</strong>
</p>
<p>It can be found in our forests, mangroves, parks and gardens, and tends
to stay close to water bodies. It is mainly terrestrial but can also climb
trees. It can sometimes be seen diving into the water from treetops at
mangroves at Pasir Ris Park and Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve.</p>
<p></p>
<p>It can also be found in urban areas, usually near canals.&nbsp;It is distributed
from Sri Lanka and southern China to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Did you know?</strong>
</p>
<p>When you see two monitors “hugging” each other, they are actually two
males engaged in a wrestling match. The one that pushes the other onto
the ground wins the favour of the female monitor they are trying to impress!</p>

<p><strong>What does it look like?</strong>
</p>
<p>This introduced lizard is commonly spotted on tree trunks in our parks
and urban areas. It is often mistaken for a chameleon, which is not found
in this region. It has a stout body with ridged scales and a spiny crest
along the middle of its nape and back. Its long tail can grow up to twice
its body length!</p>
<p>They are sexually dimorphic. Males are larger with swollen cheeks and
develop bright orange heads with a black blotch on their cheeks and throat
during breeding season.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Behaviour and Ecology</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Diet and Behaviour</strong>
</p>
<p>It eats insects and other smaller lizards. It is active during the day
and is often found basking on bushes and trees. During breeding season,
males become more territorial and can be seen displaying head bobs and
“push-ups” to attract females.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Where is it found?</strong>
</p>
<p>The Changeable Lizard was believed to have been introduced into Singapore
in the 1980s and has rapidly spread across the island, including urban
areas. Our native lizard, the Green Crested Lizard (<em>Bronchocela cristatella</em>),
has been largely displaced by the Changeable Lizard and is now not commonly
seen.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Its native range encompasses the Middle East, the Indian Subcontinent,
China and Southeast Asia. It has been introduced to Singapore, the United
States and Brunei, among other places.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Did you know?</strong>
</p>
<p>Unlike many lizards, it does not drop its tail when in danger. This phenomenon,
called autotomy, acts as a distraction to predators to help the lizard
escape.</p>

<p><strong>What does it look like?</strong>
</p>
<p>This common gecko has thin skin and non-overlapping scales. Its toes are
expanded into pads that allow it to stick to vertical surfaces such as
trees and walls. It has whorls of small spines on its tail unless the tail
had been autotomised (dropped) and regrown.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Behaviour and Ecology</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Diet and Behaviour</strong>
</p>
<p>Geckos are nocturnal lizards that hide during the day and are often seen
climbing walls of buildings in search of insects at night. True to their
name, they have a preference for urban environments. They can carry out
autotomy, where they shed their tail as a self-defence mechanism.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Where are they found?</strong>
</p>
<p>It is very adaptable and is often seen in urban areas and nearby forests.
While it is a tropical lizard that is native to Southeast Asia, it has
also been introduced to many countries in the Americas, Pacific and other
parts of Asia where it has negatively impacted native gecko species.</p>

<p><strong>What does it look like?</strong>
</p>
<p>These terrapins are a common sight in Singapore as they are popular pets.
However, they are an exotic species. They have a dome-shaped shell that
is olive brown with yellowish streaks. They are easily identified by the
broad red stripe behind their eye. Some individuals can be found in the
Eco Pond at Lakeside Garden. The shell of a typical Red-eared Slider grows
to about 15-20 cm long.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Behaviour and Ecology</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Diet and Behaviour</strong>
</p>
<p>While they will eat whatever they can find, they are mostly herbivorous.
As they are cold-blooded, like other reptiles, they often need to sunbathe
to maintain their body temperature. You can often spot them lying on rocks
motionlessly, basking in the sun.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Where is it found?</strong>
</p>
<p>Due to the release of unwanted pets, the Red-eared Slider is found in
almost every freshwater pond and reservoir in Singapore. It is native to
North America and is the most widely traded pet reptile in the world. It
is mostly bought as an attractive juvenile but is often released into the
wild when it reaches adulthood by irresponsible pet owners.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Did you know?</strong>
</p>
<p>It is illegal to release or abandon any animal in our parks and nature
reserves. The Red-Eared Slider’s ability to survive in a wide range of
freshwater habitats makes it a potential threat to our native aquatic biodiversity!</p>

<p>Adults of this beautiful snake are a striking bright green, while juveniles
are brownish. It has yellow eyes, with horizontally elongated pupils.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Behaviour and Ecology</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Diet and Behaviour</strong>
</p>
<p>It eats mainly small lizards as well as frogs and small birds. Its body
colour camouflages it well among the foliage during the daytime when it
is most active.</p>
<p>When threatened, it will extend its tongue and leave it out as a warning.
It is usually docile but is mildly venomous.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Where is it found?</strong>
</p>
<p>The Oriental Whip Snake is arboreal, meaning it lives in trees and bushes.
It is common in our forests, urban gardens and coastal areas like mangrove
forests. It is found throughout Southeast Asia, China, Indochina and the
Indian subcontinent.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Did you know?</strong>
</p>
<p>While it may seem like the female Oriental Whip Snake gives birth to live
young, this is actually a case of ovovivipary, where the eggs produced
by the female hatch within its body!</p>

<p>They can be found in many countries across Southeast Asia.</p>

<p>Individuals in Malaysia and Singapore tend to have a series of dark stripes
on their upper bodies, while those in Java and other territories may have
spotted or speckled forms. Their snouts are pointed and only their hind
feet are webbed.</p>
<p></p>

<p><strong>Behaviour and Ecology</strong>
</p>

<p><strong>Diet and Behaviour</strong>
</p>
<p>They feed on insects at night. They live on plants and breed at the edge
