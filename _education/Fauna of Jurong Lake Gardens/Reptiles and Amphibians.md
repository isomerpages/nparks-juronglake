<p>Jurong Lake Gardens is home to a number of reptile and amphibian species.
Both reptiles and amphibians are ectotherms, or cold-blooded, and rely
on external sources to maintain their body temperature. You’ll often see
reptiles such as water monitor lizards and terrapins basking in the sun
to warm up.</p>
<p>Reptiles lay eggs with shells on land. Most amphibians, on the other hand,
begin their life as eggs in water that hatch into aquatic larvae (e.g.
tadpoles), which later develop into adults that can survive on land. These
eggs are covered by a transparent jelly-like substance.</p>

<p><strong>What does it look like?</strong>
</p>
<p>It is a large greyish brown lizard with leathery skin and non-overlapping
scales. Its tongue is slender and forked. In Singapore, it is often mistaken
for the Estuarine Crocodile (<em>Crocodylus porosus</em>) and is also a
smaller relative of the Komodo Dragon (<em>Varanus komodoensis</em>). You
can usually spot a few of them roaming around Jurong Lake Gardens.</p>

<p><strong>Behaviour and Ecology</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Diet and Behaviour</strong>
</p>
<p>The Malayan Water Monitor eats fishes, frogs, crabs, birds and other small
animals, and has been known to scavenge on dead animals. It hunts during
the day. This generalist diet allows it to be very adaptable to even highly
disturbed environments.</p>
<p></p>
<p>These reptiles are usually shy, preferring to run from disturbance. It
is advisable to leave them alone as they may become aggressive when cornered.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Where is it found?</strong>
</p>
<p>It can be found in our forests, mangroves, parks and gardens, and tends
to stay close to water bodies. It is mainly terrestrial but can also climb
trees. It can sometimes be seen diving into the water from treetops at
mangroves at Pasir Ris Park and Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve.</p>
<p></p>
<p>It can also be found in urban areas, usually near canals.&nbsp;It is distributed
from Sri Lanka and southern China to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Did you know?</strong>
</p>
<p>When you see two monitors “hugging” each other, they are actually two
males engaged in a wrestling match. The one that pushes the other onto
the ground wins the favour of the female monitor they are trying to impress!</p>
