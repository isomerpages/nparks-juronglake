<p><em>Clusia Cove and Forest Ramble are closed every Mondays for Maintenance and Tuesdays if preceding Monday is a Public Holiday.</em>
</p>
<p>Children can play to their hearts’ content at <strong><a href="https://www.nparks.gov.sg/juronglakegardens/explore-our-gardens/attractions/forest-ramble-(nature-playgarden)" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Forest Ramble</a></strong>,
which is a nature-inspired playground with play elements that encourage
kids to mimic the actions and motions of the animals that inhabit the freshwater
swamp habitat. Here, playing is infused with learning and children get
to learn more about the different behaviors of animals, which we coexist
with. Glide gracefully through the air like the Grey Heron, leap around
like the Plantain Squirrel, or splash around like the playful Smooth-coated
Otter. Head over now to discover 13 of our unique adventure stations.</p>

<p>At <strong><a href="https://www.nparks.gov.sg/juronglakegardens/explore-our-gardens/attractions/clusia-cove" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Clusia Cove</a></strong>,
children can experience a unique water playground experience featuring
tidal patterns, surface ripples and directional currents that mimic water
movement of coastal shores. They can also learn about how the water they
are playing in is cleansed by natural treatment methods using a water recycling
system. As water from the play areas flow into the Eco Pond, it is filtered
by a cleansing biotope consisting of aquatic plants. Head over to find
out more about the aquatic plants that make up the cleansing biotope.&nbsp;</p>
