<h2>Greenery with waterscapes</h2>
<p>Featuring floral and aquatic gardens, the rejuvenated Japanese Garden
interweaves greenery with waterscapes, showcasing the colours and textures
of our tropical flora, with elements of Japanese garden design and landscape.</p>
<p>Mature trees, including the Cycads planted by Japanese Emperor Akihito
and Empress Michiko in 1970, form part of the enhanced landscape. New bridges
to the north and east of the island provide greater connectivity within
the Gardens as well as to the greater Jurong Lake District.&nbsp;</p>
