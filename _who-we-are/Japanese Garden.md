<p>There will be floral and aquatic gardens to showcase the colours of the
tropics. A section of the Japanese Garden will be enhanced with a layer
of tropical flora. Mature trees, including the Cycads planted by Japanese
Emperor Akihito and Empress Michiko in 1970, will form part of the enhanced
landscape. New bridges to the north and east of the island provide greater
connectivity within the Gardens as well as to the greater Jurong Lake District.&nbsp;</p>
