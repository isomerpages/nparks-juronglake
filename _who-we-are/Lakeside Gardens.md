<p>Lakeside Garden is the 60-hectare western section of the Jurong Lake Gardens.
Visitors can now enjoy the first phase of Singaporeâ€™s third national gardens,
and the first national gardens in the heartlands.&nbsp;Lakeside Garden
is centred around the themes of nature, play and the community.
<br>
<br>The garden has been developed sensitively to retain the serenity of the
area whilst incorporating spaces for the community and recreational needs.
Capitalising on its waterfront location, Lakeside Garden has spaces for
all to enjoy amid nature, greenery and lakeside views. Visitors will have
many opportunities to get close to nature in Lakeside Garden.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>In line with the car-lite strategy of Jurong Lake District, the public is encouraged to walk, cycle or take public transport to the Gardens.</em>
