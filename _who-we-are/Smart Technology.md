<h4><strong>Integrated Management System</strong></h4>
<p>An Integrated Management System (IMS) will be implemented at Jurong Lake
Gardens. IMS will aid in the monitoring and control of multiple systems
in an automated and centralised manner. This is commonly used for buildings,
where it is known as a Building Management System (BMS). This is the first
time such a system is implemented in a park or garden. There are plans
to eventually implement this across the Jurong Lake District and in various
parks throughout Singapore.</p>

<h4><strong>Mass Engineered Timber</strong></h4>
<p>The Gardens will showcase a new method of construction using Mass Engineered
Timber (MET), which is more sustainable and productive. MET comprises engineered
wood products with improved structural integrity. The building components
are prefabricated off-site and assembled on-site, thus reducing construction
time and improving productivity. Its high strength-to- weight ratio makes
it easier to handle than steel and concrete, allowing it to be installed
more easily in a shorter amount of time. MET buildings can be built four
times faster than a concrete building, with less noise, cranage and waste.
MET can also help save on material use as it can be left exposed without
the need for finishing material to be applied over it. The Guesthouse will
be built in GLULAM (a type of MET) which has the unique capability to span
large distances without the need for supporting columns.&nbsp;Other buildings
that are built using MET include Rainforest Pavilion in Lakeside Garden
and Water Lily Pavilion in Japanese Garden.</p>

<h4><strong>Interactive&nbsp;Kiosks</strong></h4>
<p>Jurong Lake Gardens has brought technology into the Gardens through our
Interactive Kiosks. The Interactive Kiosk is designed to provide visitors
with their wayfinding needs. The kiosk directory showcases all the attractions
in the Gardens, and provides an overview for visitors to plan their visit.
The Interactive Kiosk also showcases the list of events happening around
the Gardens, ranging from crafts for children to gardening workshops and
guided walks. The Interactive Kiosks are situated at the following locations
â€“ Shelter at South Carpark, Gardenhouse, Entrance Pavilion and Play Pavilion.&nbsp;</p>
