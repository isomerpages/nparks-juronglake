<p>Jurong Lake Gardens contributes to the identity of Jurong Lake District,
which is envisioned as a district of gardens and water. The green spaces
and waterways will extend from the Gardens into the district. It will eventually
comprise 100 hectares of green spaces, 70 hectares of water bodies and
17 km of waterfront areas for social and community activities, as well
as spaces for recreation, retail and F&amp;B outlets.</p>
