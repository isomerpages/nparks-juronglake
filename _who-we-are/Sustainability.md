<h4><strong>Super Low Energy Buildings</strong></h4>
<p>In 2018, Building and Construction Authority (BCA) launched the new Green
Mark scheme for Super Low Energy (SLE) and Zero Energy Buildings (ZEB).
Jurong Lake Gardens aspires to be a showcase of sustainability. The Gardens
took up the challenge of operating its main buildings with super low energy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Gardens also achieved the BCA Green Mark Platinum SLE in 2021.</p>
<h4><strong>Water systems</strong></h4>
<p>To promote climate resilience, water-sensitive urban designs have been
incorporated in the Gardens. Being located around the lake, Jurong Lake
Gardens has many features such as swales and bioretention basins to cleanse
the water runoff from the rain. Rainwater is then collected in the inland
ponds and harvested to water the plants within the Gardens. The water is
also circulated through phytoremediation ponds and biotopes which consist
of a series of cleansing cells containing sand beds that filter out particulate
matter, helping to clean the water over time. The water in Clusia Cove
has a closed loop water circulation system that links the cleansing biotope,
water playground and eco-pond, ensuring water is constantly recycled, yet
clean. These water systems help to maintain the water quality and prevent
algal blooms.</p>

<br>At Japanese Garden, a smart water management system has been implemented,
which includes a water pump and filtration system that utilises natural
vegetation and soil microbes to clean and restore the water within the
Water Lily Garden and the larger Japanese Garden. This is supported by
a donation of S$1 million by Micron Technology, through the Garden City
Fund, NParksâ€™ registered charity and IPC.</p>

<h4><strong>Carbon dioxide mineralised concrete</strong></h4>
<p>Nearly all the footpaths within the northern section of Lakeside Garden,
as well as all the footpaths within Chinese and Japanese Gardens, are made
of carbon dioxide mineralised concrete, which utilises a technology that
recycles carbon dioxide by converting captured atmospheric carbon into
a nanomineral that becomes permanently embedded in concrete structures.
This improves the compressive strength of the concrete, while lowering
carbon emissions during the construction process.</p>
