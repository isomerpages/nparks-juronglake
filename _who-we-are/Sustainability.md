<h4><strong>Super Low Energy Buildings</strong></h4>
<p>In 2018, Building and Construction Authority (BCA) launched the new Green
Mark scheme for Super Low Energy (SLE) and Zero Energy Buildings (ZEB).
Jurong Lake Gardens aspires to be a showcase of sustainability. The Gardens
took up the challenge of operating its main buildings with super low energy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Gardens also achieved the BCA Green Mark Platinum SLE in 2021.</p>
<h4><strong>Water systems</strong></h4>
<p>To promote climate resilience, water-sensitive urban designs have been
incorporated in the Gardens. Being located around the lake, Jurong Lake
Gardens has many features such as swales and bioretention basins to cleanse
the water runoff from the rain. Rainwater is then collected in the inland
ponds and harvested to water the plants within the Gardens. The water is
also circulated through phytoremediation ponds and biotopes which consist
of a series of cleansing cells containing sand beds that filter out particulate
matter, helping to clean the water over time. The water in Clusia Cove
has a closed loop water circulation system that links the cleansing biotope,
water playground and eco-pond, ensuring water is constantly recycled, yet
clean. These water systems help to maintain the water quality and prevent
algal blooms.</p>
