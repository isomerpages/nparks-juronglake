<p>Children can conquer a maze set within an undulating landscape filled
with butterflies. Unlike a traditional hedge maze, children will find themselves
traversing an open landscape with changing views as they climb up and down
the mounds in search of a way out. Young adventurers will enjoy themselves
exploring the maze, discovering surprises and hidden treasures along the
way. This includes quiet corners, rest areas, slides, and informative signs
throughout the maze for children to learn about pollination and the lifecycle
of butterflies.</p>

<p>The maze also adjoins the childrenâ€™s section of the <a href="https://www.nparks.gov.sg/juronglakegardens/explore-our-gardens/attractions/therapeutic-garden" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Therapeutic Garden</a>&nbsp;to
provide young visitors more opportunities to experience the therapeutic
effects of greenery, as well as help with the facilitation of therapeutic
horticulture programmes for children.</p>

<p><em>Visitors are not encouraged to enter the Butterfly Maze from 7pm - 7am as the lighting conditions are dim.</em>
