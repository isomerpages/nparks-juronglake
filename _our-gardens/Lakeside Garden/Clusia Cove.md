<p>Clusia&nbsp;Cove is a&nbsp;three-hectare water&nbsp;playground where children
can experience water movements that mimic tidal patterns, surface ripples
and directional currents similar to those at coastal&nbsp;shores. Here,
water play is infused with learning as they get to learn about the dynamics
of water and the natural tides cycle.</p>

<p>Furthermore, they can also learn about how the water they are playing
in is cleansed by natural treatment methods using a water recycling system.
The water in Clusia Cove is in a closed loop circulation that links the
cleansing biotope, water playground and eco-pond.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;cleansing biotope serves as a natural water treatment system
that consists of a series of cleansing cells containing sand beds that
filter out particulate matter, as well as semi-aquatic plants which absorb
excess nutrients from the water and release oxygen, reducing algae growth
while cleansing the water. Did you know that plants like the Common Susum
(<em>Hanguana malayanum</em>) plays a role in water treatment? Head over
to discover our Plantae cleansing helpers.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;water then filters through the cleansing cells into an underground
ultraviolet (UV) room where it is further purified with Active Filter Media
(AFM), then disinfected by UV treatment before being pumped to the water
playground for visitors to play safely.&nbsp;</p>
<p>From the water playground, water enters the eco-pond that simulates a
freshwater wetland ecosystem. Here, the substrate surface acts as a filter
that traps debris and promote the growth of beneficial bacteria. Semi-aquatic
plants present in the eco-pond does the initial round of cleansing before
water is pumped into the biotope again, and the closed-loop circulation
repeats, constantly maintaining the water quality.</p>
<p>Have you ever wondered how the name “Clusia Cove” came about? It is named
after one of the semi aquatic plants found in the eco-pond, the Autograph
Tree (<em>Clusia rosea)</em>.</p>
