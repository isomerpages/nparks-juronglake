<p>Heron island is a 4000m<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;island away from mainland that
allows birds and other biodiversity to breed or roost without the intervention
of humans. Natural platforms are installed as an enhancement to encourage
our resident herons to roost and nest away from human disturbance.</p>

<p>There are more than 10 species of herons recorded in Jurong Lake Gardens,
such as the Grey Heron (<em>Ardea cinerea</em>), Striated Heron (<em>Butorides striata</em>)
and Chinese Pond Heron (<em>Ardeola bacchus</em>). Visitors can try to
spot our resident herons and observe them safely from a distance.</p>
