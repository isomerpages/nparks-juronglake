<p>A warm welcome to Jurong Lake Gardens.</p>
<p>The Entrance Pavilion is one of the main entrances into Jurong Lake Gardens.
Located next to the North Carpark, the Entrance Pavilion serves as gateway
that brings visitors to the garden’s popular attractions in the north such
as Clusia Cove and Forest Ramble.</p>
<p>Taking inspiration from nature, the Entrance Pavilion is designed to resemble
the crown of a Malayan Banyan (<em>Ficus microcarpa</em>), , with pillars
resembling the tree’s aerial roots and the “holes” in the ceiling resembling
the shape of the Malayan Banyan’s trunk. Visitors can look up and imagine
themselves standing under the restful shade of the Malayan Banyan, with
rays of sunlight penetrating the canopy.</p>
<p>Visitors can visit the Information Counter if they have any queries and
our friendly Visitor Services counter staff will be glad to help. Wheelchairs
are available for rental at the Information Counter from 8.30am to 6.30
am daily.</p>
