<p><strong><u>Alstonia</u>&nbsp;Island</strong>
</p>
<p>Alstonia&nbsp;Island is named after the dominant tree species,&nbsp;<em>Alstonia&nbsp;spatulata</em>,
planted on the island. Commonly known as Marsh&nbsp;Pulai, this species
has adapted to survive and grow in areas that are constantly flooded. The
island has conditions similar to that of a freshwater swamp, as it is constantly
flooded.</p>

<p><strong><u>Freshwater Swamp</u></strong>

<p>The freshwater swamp forest is a habitat that is rich in biodiversity,
teeming with unique plants and animals. The flora and fauna of the forest
have adapted to cope with constant flooding. For example, some plants have
evolved unique root systems such as&nbsp;<em>Xylopia fusca</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Alstonia pneumatophora</em>.</p>
