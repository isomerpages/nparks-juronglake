<p>The Canyon consists of a series of gabion walls covered in beautiful and
lush greenery. The reddish-orange rocks that make up The Canyon were salvaged
from excavated material during the development of Lakeside Garden.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The unique red coloration comes from the high iron concentration within
the rocks. A plethora of plant species that grow on The Canyon. Amongst
these are the Bamboo Orchid (<em>Arundina graminiflora</em>) and Mexican
Petunia (<em>Ruellia</em>  <em>simplex</em>) with their vibrant pink and
purple flowers.</p>
