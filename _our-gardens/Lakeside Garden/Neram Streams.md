Singapore has led to us relooking our built environment and exploring features
that complement the natural environment.</p>

<p>One example is converting a concrete drain leading from Yuan Ching Road
to Jurong Lake into a series of naturalised streams. Now called Neram Streams,
they channel stormwater runoff from the surrounding gardens. The stormwater
is cleansed by plantings in the streams and eventually flows into Jurong
Lake, one of Singapore’s 17 reservoirs.</p>

<p>Guided walks along the trail provide opportunities for visitors to learn
about the area’s rich biodiversity, and to get close to the shallow waters
of the streams.</p>
