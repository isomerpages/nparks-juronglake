<p>Dominated&nbsp;by tall grasses, Grasslands are an important habitat for
many small bird species that feed on grass seeds and seek shelter in the
grass. There are three bird hides located around the Grasslands.</p>

<p>The Lone&nbsp;Tree stands tall amongst the grasses and forms a feature
point that punctuates the expanse of the grasslands. Its branches offer
an unobstructed view of the grasslands, making it an ideal perch for raptors
such as the&nbsp;Brahminy Kite (<em>Haliastur&nbsp;indus</em>).</p>

(Pennisetum rubrum), West Indian Lemon Grass (Cymbopogon citratus) and
