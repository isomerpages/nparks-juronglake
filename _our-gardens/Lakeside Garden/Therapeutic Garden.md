<p>The Therapeutic Garden consists of two sections – one designed for adults
and another for children, with features specially curated for seniors with
dementia and children with conditions such as mild autism and ADHD respectively.
Both sections are wheelchair-accessible.</p>

<p>The Therapeutic Garden for adults provides a space for reminiscing, with
familiar edible plants arranged in zones (Fragrance zone, Edibles zone
and a Plant Zoo)&nbsp;and nostalgic features like a stone chess table.
A shelter with an extended trellis and movable planters can serve as an
activity hub for organised events. Located next to the shelter are also
two movable raised planters that permit seniors on wheelchairs to garden.</p>

<p>The Therapeutic Garden for children is designed to cater for children
with mild autism, ADHD and physical disabilities. It is designed with various
sensory zones (for smell, touch, sound and sight) which includes play elements,
such as musical play instruments, a wheelchair-friendly crawling trellis,
a labyrinth with glow in the dark pathways and floor imprints of the animals
and insects found in Jurong Lake Gardens. It is also connected to the adult’s
section of the Therapeutic Garden and adjoins the <a href="https://juronglakegardens.nparks.gov.sg/butterfly-maze/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Butterfly Maze</a>&nbsp;to
provide more opportunities for young visitors to experience the therapeutic
effects of greenery.</p>
