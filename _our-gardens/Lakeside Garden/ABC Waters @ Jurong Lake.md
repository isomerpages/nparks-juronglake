<p>Located next to Clusia Cove, the boardwalk at Jurong Lake provides a scenic
and up-close view of nature for visitors. The boardwalk is an initiative
under National Water Agency PUB’s Active, Beautiful, Clean Waters (ABC
Waters) Programme to revitalise Singapore’s water bodies, and help enhance
the liveability of the environment.</p>
<p>Visitors can observe the abundant wildlife in Jurong Lake up close, and
admire the lush greenery and scenery around the lake. Visitors can also
rest and admire the lake from the amphitheatre located next to the boardwalk.&nbsp;</p>
