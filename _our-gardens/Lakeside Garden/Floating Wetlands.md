<p>Located at the north of Jurong Lake Gardens, the floating wetlands is
the largest man-made floating wetland in Singapore. Managed under National
Water Agency PUBâ€™s Active, Beautiful, Clean Waters (ABC Waters) Programme,
the wetlands not only play a part in maintaining the water quality in the
reservoir but also creates a natural habitat for wildlife. Visitors can
take a walk along the boardwalk to enjoy the scenic views of the lake and
admire the flora and fauna thriving on the wetlands.</p>
