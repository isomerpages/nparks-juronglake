<p>The Logs Trail is made from materials recycled from Rain Trees (<em>Samanea saman</em>)
and Senegal Mahogany (<em>Khaya senegalensis</em>) trees. The untreated
logs are held together to form a series of adventurous paths with different
elevations, and is intended to age naturally in the weather.</p>

<p>Visitors can observe parts that make up a tree, including the protective
bark, sapwood, heartwood, and growth rings that form the wood grain. After
rain, fungi may spring from the channels in the wood. These fungi act as
decomposers and break down organic matter to release carbon, oxygen, nitrogen
and phosphorous back into the soil and atmosphere.</p>

<p>In the fungi section of the Logs Trail, please do not climb or step on
the logs as the fungi are decomposing the logs and weakening the wood tissue.
Please be careful when you make your way through the Logs Trail as the
surface may be slippery when moist.</p>
