<p>Located at the southernmost end of Lakeside Garden, the 8-hectare Southern
Promenade has been conserved as a key habitat for wildlife. Situated away
from the bustling activities at the north, visitors can enjoy undisturbed
tranquility and find themselves enveloped in the lush greenery of Jurong
Lake.</p>

<p>The fresh air and tranquil surroundings allow visitors to unwind from
stress as they explore the area. Visitors can also relax at the viewing
decks and take in the views of the Jurong Lake while being immersed in
nature, or embark on a fishing adventure there.</p>

<p>Conserved as a habitat for wildlife, the Southern Promenade is perfect
for spotting the great diversity of flora and fauna present in Lakeside
Gardens. Native birds such as the Coppersmith Barbet (<em>Megalaima haemacephala</em>)
and Yellow-vented Bulbul (<em>Pycnonotus goiavier</em>) roosts in the mature
Malayan Banyan (<em>Ficus microcarpa</em>) and Rain Trees (<em>Samanea saman</em>)
present. The aerial roots of the Banyan, and umbrella-shaped crown of the
Rain Trees help provide the necessary shelter and lodging for this unique
wildlife to flourish.</p>
