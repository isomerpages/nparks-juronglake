<p>Located at the southern entrance, Floral Garden showcases innovative garden
artistry through curated displays. Inspired by the design principles of
traditional Japanese gardens, it features rocks, bamboos, and ornamental
trees in tranquil landscapes.</p>
<p>This space serves as a practical learning platform for students from Institutes
of Higher Learning (IHLs), allowing them to design planting plots and learn
about the evolution of a landscape. The community plots here have been
co-created with the Institute of Technical Education (ITE) College East,
Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts (NAFA) and Singapore Polytechnic, as well
as JTC.</p>
