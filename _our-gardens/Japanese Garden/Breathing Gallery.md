<p>Immerse yourself in the Breathing Gallery, an innovative showcase of living
art. Here, terrariums, aquariums, and paludariums come together to offer
an immersive journey into the world of vivariums – a contained space designed
to mimic natural habitats for observing or studying plants or animals –
and cutting-edge aquascaping.</p>
<p>The gallery's three-part design – terrestrial, aquatic, and living room
– provides a comprehensive exploration of these captivating miniature ecosystems.
The Living Room zone, featuring household-inspired displays like the Green
Cabinet and Terra Wall Paludarium, demonstrates how natural beauty can
seamlessly integrate into modern living spaces.</p>
<p>Aquascaping styles vary widely: Iwagumi employs minimalist rock arrangements,
Dutch focuses on lush plant diversity and terracing, while Nature style
recreates miniature natural scenes using rocks, driftwood, and plants.
Each offers a unique approach to underwater landscape design.</p>

<p></p>
<p>Iwagumi, a rock-based aquascaping style, is the essence of Japanese minimalism.
Rooted in Zen philosophy, this technique creates tranquil underwater landscapes
through precise stone placement. Each carefully positioned rock contributes
to a harmonious composition, offering a serene visual experience that embodies
the spirit of Suiseki stone arrangement.</p>

<p></p>
<p>Dutch aquascaping, a style popular since the 30s that transforms tanks
into thriving subaquatic gardens, emphasises on plant diversity, health,
and strategic terracing – the layered look that this style is known for,
which creates a rich tapestry of plant colours and textures.</p>

</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p></p>
<p>The Nature style, pioneered by Takashi Amano in the 90s, was inspired
by the Japanese Wabi-Sabi aesthetics of embracing the beauty in imperfection.
These aquascapes recreate breathtaking natural scenes in miniature and,
through the artful combination of rocks, driftwood, and carefully selected
flora, underwater worlds are crafted that embody tranquillity and natural
harmony.</p>
