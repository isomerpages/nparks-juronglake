<p>This carefully crafted microclimate environment nurtures a diverse ecosystem
of Bryophytes and Pteridophytes, while offering visitors a refreshing respite
from tropical heat.</p>
<p>At its heart, a cenote-inspired water feature serves as both a stunning
centrepiece and an eco-friendly rainwater harvesting system. Adorning the
living, breathing moss wall constructed from Paras stones are over 200
species of epiphytes including rare orchids, ferns, and bromeliads.</p>
<p>Experience the Sunken Garden as a living gallery, where the soothing symphony
of water features harmonises with the lush beauty of moisture-loving flora.</p>
