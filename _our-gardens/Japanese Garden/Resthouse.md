<p>The Resthouse blends traditional Japanese architecture with modern sustainability,
is a popular gathering spot which offers stunning views of the Japanese
Garden pond on one side and the Freshwater Forest and Jurong Lake on the
other.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The adjacent Freshwater Forest recreates a native swamp habitat, featuring
shallow waters, ferns, moss, and partially submerged trees such as the
water-tolerant <em>Dolichandrone serrulata</em>. From the Resthouse's deck,
visitors can enjoy the tranquil cascade of water over Paras stones.</p>
