<p>The seven-storey Cloud Pagoda 入云塔 (rù yún tǎ), a masterpiece of architectural
symbolism and panoramic beauty, stands as a testament to ancient Chinese
wisdom and design and it stands atop of the Cloud Pagoda Plateau 云台揽胜 (yún
tái lǎn shèng).</p>
<p>At its pinnacle sits the Cloud Terrace 云台 (yún tái), offering a theoretical
vantage point that would provide an unparalleled 360-degree panorama of
the landscape. This highest point of the garden embodies the ancient Chinese
proverb: "One must be higher to see further.”</p>
<p>Encircling the pagoda are 12 Chinese Zodiac stone statues, adding a layer
of cultural richness to the site.</p>
