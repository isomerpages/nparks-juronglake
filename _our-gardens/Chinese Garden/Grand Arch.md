<p>An enduring icon of the Chinese Garden since 1975, this beloved landmark,
along with the White Rainbow Bridge, has been meticulously retained to
honour cherished memories while embracing modern enhancements.</p>
<p>Today, the Grand Arch area offers a diverse array of attractions: from
the Jurong Lake Gardens Gallery, which showcases the Gardens' rich history
and features, to the Plant Factory which presents an innovative indoor
showcase of sustainable horticulture. Canopy, a pet- and family-friendly
restaurant, provides a welcoming space overlooking the Edible Garden.</p>
<p>The Chinese phrase 乾坤清气 (qián kūn qīng qì) gracing the Grand Arch symbolises
"the pure energy of Heaven and Earth." This elegant inscription represents
the balance of masculine and feminine energies (乾坤) and the essence of
pure vitality (清气) in Chinese philosophy.</p>
