<h2>An icon since 1975</h2>
<p>The Grand Arch has been an iconic feature of the Chinese Garden since
the garden first opened to the public in 1975. As a landmark at the entrance
to the Chinese Garden, it is captured in the memories of many tourists
and Singaporean families who visited the gardens over the years. Together
with the White Rainbow Bridge, the Grand Arch has been conserved in efforts
to preserve these memories while the complex is further enhanced with a
variety of facilities to enrich visitors’ experiences.</p>

<p>The Phrase, 乾坤清气 (qián kūn qīng qì), written on the Grand Arch, refers
to the pure energy of Heaven and Earth. 乾坤 (qián kūn) refers to “Heaven
and Earth”, often symbolising the Masculine (Heaven) and Feminine (Earth)
principles in Chinese philosophy. Meanwhile, 清气 (qīng qì) symbolises pure
energy or clear vitality, suggesting a harmonious life force.&nbsp;</p>
