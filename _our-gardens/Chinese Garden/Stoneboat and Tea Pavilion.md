<h3>Stoneboat</h3>
<p>Gracing the shores of the Chinese Garden's Lotus Pond, the Stoneboat 邀月舫
(yāo yuè fǎng) stands as a testament to architectural elegance. Its name,
meaning "the boat where one invites the Moon” reflects ancient Chinese
wisdom about waterside lunar views.</p>
<p>This two-storey marvel blends traditional Peking style with modern adaptations,
honouring heritage while embracing contemporary design.</p>
<p>Once a branch of the Registrar of Marriage, the Stoneboat now stands as
a picturesque symbol of our dedication to creating inspiring, culturally
rich environments.</p>
<h3>Tea Pavilion</h3>
<p>Behold "The Gallery of Tea Fragrance" 茗香榭 (míng xiāng xiè), the captivating
Tea Pavilion. This architectural marvel features three pavilions connected
by a winding corridor, seemingly floating above the Lotus Pond – a design
inspired by the Summer Palace.</p>
<p>A poetic stone inscription greets visitors, inviting contemplation of
the serene surroundings, including views of the Stoneboat. Steeped in Ming
Dynasty heritage, this space honours the sophisticated art of tea culture
and celebrates the art of tea, brewing techniques, elegance, and creativity
in a timeless experience.</p>
