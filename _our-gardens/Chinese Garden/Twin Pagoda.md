<p>Experience architectural harmony at the Twin Pagoda 云月双塔<strong> </strong>(yún
yuè shuāng tǎ), where East Asian design principles meet modern aesthetics.
This striking three-storey feature showcases the Cloud Draping Tower 披云阁<strong> </strong>(pī
yún gé) and Moon Receiving Tower 延月楼<strong> </strong>(yán yuè lóu), faithful
replicas of the Spring-Autumn Tower from Southern China.</p>
<p>Featuring spiral staircases and panoramic balconies, these lakeside pagodas
exemplify classic Chinese design. Their contrasting forms embody the Yin-Yang
principle: the broader tower representing Yang, the slender one Yin.</p>
