<p>Embark on an immersive journey through the Cascading Creek, a meticulously
designed habitat that brings the wonders of Southeast Asian river ecosystems
to life. This experience offers visitors a unique opportunity to explore
and understand the vital role of water systems in our natural world, from
highland streams to lowland swamps.</p>
<p>The closed-loop boardwalk trail guides visitors through five distinct
river stages: Fern Cascades, Hill Streams, Kasai Creek, Paperback Swamp,
and Nypa Grove. As you explore, witness how changing geological and microclimatic
conditions shape diverse habitats and support varied flora and fauna.</p>
