<h1><strong>Melodies in Nature: A Flautist's Musical Escape in Japanese Garden</strong></h1>
<p>The night is balmy. Aside from a few leisurely strollers, the Resthouse
in the Japanese Gardens is quiet, a serene escape from the madding crowd
at the Chinese Garden, where lantern displays and light shows draw throngs
of visitors.</p>
<p>A sweet, soulful tune drifts from a corner of the Fumeikaku, a traditional
Japanese open shelter overlooking a tranquil pond, with the placid Jurong
Lake just beyond. It’s a perfect setting for peaceful moments, quiet contemplation,
and a deep connection with nature.</p>

<p>The music of a flute floats like a gentle breeze, effortlessly light yet
moving. Its delicate and ethereal notes weave gracefully through the air,
soothing and uplifting all at once. The few strollers within earshot slow
down to listen.</p>
<p>Mr. Ng Cheng Huat, 65, a solitary figure against the backdrop of pondside
trees, is completely immersed in his music. He reads notes from a basket
on his trusty bicycle, blissfully unaware of his motley audience.</p>
<p>The flautist plays another melody filled with crisp, bright, and playful
notes, evoking joy and lightness.</p>
<p>A retiree who helps at his family provision shop, Mr. Ng cycles from his
home on Yuan Ching Road to this same spot two to three evenings a week,
or early in the mornings, to practice his flute. He has lived in Jurong
for over two decades.</p>
<p>Mr. Ng has been playing the flute for more than 30 years, having learned
the basics from a class at a community club. He chose the flute for its
calming effect, which he says quiets the mind and soothes the soul, providing
a respite from the distractions of everyday life.</p>
<p>The flute can convey a wide range of emotions, evoking feelings of peace,
nostalgia, and a sweet yearning for something just out of reach - a memory,
a dream, or a place of comfort. Joyful, lively tunes can lift the spirit,
while mournful melodies express deep sorrow and longing.</p>
<p>“A flute is small, lightweight, portable, and affordable - and it makes
beautiful music,” he says, proudly pointing to his 46 cm long flute, which
is more than 10 years old and costs less than $20.</p>
<p>Mr. Ng says he prefers classical Chinese tunes, as they evoke nostalgia
and melancholy, while Chinese New Year pieces uplift his mood and create
a festive atmosphere. When asked for his favorite tune, he obligingly plays
a short Chinese piece, "Lover's Bridge." The bittersweet melody conveys
a deep sense of longing and reunion, reflecting the emotional journey of
two lovers separated by time.&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Look at this peaceful place; it’s so tranquil and serene. This calm setting
is perfect for focusing on my music and practicing mindfulness through
flute playing. The beauty of the surroundings makes it all the more enjoyable
and fulfilling</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He comes to the gardens to practice because the setting combines the beauty
of nature with the ethereal sound of his instrument. The gardens offer
natural acoustics that enhance the flute's sound, allowing the music to
resonate beautifully, creating an immersive auditory experience. Surrounded
by the scenic views and sounds of nature, Mr Ng draws endless inspiration
that influences and enriches his musical expression.</p>

<p>“Look at this peaceful place; it’s so tranquil and serene. This calm setting
is perfect for focusing on my music and practicing mindfulness through
flute playing. The beauty of the surroundings makes it all the more enjoyable
and fulfilling,” Mr. Ng remarks.</p>
<p>Playing the flute not only brings him joy but also offers numerous health
benefits. “It promotes good posture, correct breathing, improves lung capacity
and memory, and enhances overall emotional well-being. I breathe in clean,
fresh air here and breathe out the negative qi (vital energy),” he says
with a grin.</p>
<p>For Mr. Ng, combining the beauty of nature with the ethereal sound of
the flute is the ideal way to strike the right notes.</p>
