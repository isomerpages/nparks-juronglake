<p>Faces of Jurong Lake Gardens is a photo story series that captures the
heart and soul of one of Singapore’s most beloved green spaces. Through
intimate portraits and personal stories, this series celebrates the diverse
individuals and communities who bring the Gardens to life — from morning
joggers and nature lovers to families, hobbyists, and caretakers.</p>
<p>More than just a park, Jurong Lake Gardens is a shared sanctuary where
stories unfold, friendships blossom, and the spirit of community thrives
amid its lush landscapes and tranquil waters.</p>
