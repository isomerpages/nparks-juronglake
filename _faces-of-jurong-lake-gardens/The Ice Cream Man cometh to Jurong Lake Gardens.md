<h2><strong>The Ice Cream Man cometh to Jurong Lake Gardens</strong></h2>
<p></p>
<p>As a child, Lau Su How eagerly anticipated the ringing of the ice cream
man’s bell as he made his rounds in the neighborhood. He and his friends
would dash to gather around the ice cream cart, clamoring for their favorite
flavours like honey bees buzzing around flowers in search of nectar.</p>
<p>“Our faces would light up with joy as we savored the ice cream, hoping
it wouldn’t melt too quickly. It was pure, simple delight,” recalls Su
How, now 46. His passion for ice cream inspired him to embark on a journey
to establish his own venture, Ice Cream Man and Friends, in 2017.&nbsp;</p>
<p>He opened his first ice cream kiosk at Yew Tee Square in 2017, followed
by a second location at Taman Jurong Shopping Centre later that year. While
business was steady, Su How wanted a “more pleasant location” for his next
outlet, believing that people enjoy ice cream more in a relaxed environment.
His quest led him to the Singapore Botanic Gardens, where he opened his
next ice cream kiosk in November 2022, near the Jacob Ballas Children’s
Garden - a joyful playground for both children and parents. . “My partner
and I have always dreamed of running an ice cream kiosk in a garden setting,
and we are incredibly thankful to NParks for this opportunity.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>Their latest outlet is nestled in the stunning Sunken Garden of the rejuvenated
Japanese Garden in Jurong Lake Garden. Here, Su How and his staff serve&nbsp;artisanal
ice cream from a selection of 20 flavors, set against a serene backdrop
of cascading bubbling water and flourishing mossy walls adorned with a
variety of epiphytes, orchids, aroids, and ferns.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Su How says there’s a certain magic about ice cream that transcends age,
uniting the wide-eyed wonder of children with the nostalgic hearts of adults.</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote>
<p>For kids, ice cream is not just a treat; it’s an experience filled with
excitement and choice. The thrill of selecting sprinkles, the joy of licking
a melting scoop, and the refreshing chill on a warm day create memorable
moments that last a lifetime</p>
<p></p>
</blockquote>
<p>For children, the allure of ice cream is irresistible. Just picture the
excitement on a child's face as they step up to a colorful ice cream truck,
each flavor more enticing than the last - from bright bubblegum pink to
rich chocolate brown. “For kids, ice cream is not just a treat; it’s an
experience filled with excitement and choice. The thrill of selecting sprinkles,
the joy of licking a melting scoop, and the refreshing chill on a warm
day create memorable moments that last a lifetime,” says Su How.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>But the magic of ice cream doesn’t stop with children.&nbsp;For adults,
indulging in a scoop of their childhood favorite can evoke waves of nostalgia.
Each bite can transport them back to simpler times, when life was filled
with endless summers and the biggest worry was choosing between chocolate
or vanilla. Ice cream has the power to bridge the gap between generations,
creating shared moments of delight and connection.</p>
<p>Eating ice cream in a park or garden adds an extra layer of enchantment
to this experience. Surrounded by verdant greenery, the vibrant colors
of flowers, and the gentle rustling of leaves, the enjoyment of ice cream
becomes a multisensory delight. The natural beauty of the outdoors enhances
the flavors, making each bite taste even more refreshing. The warmth of
the sun, the cool breeze, and the symphony of birdsong create a perfect
backdrop for savoring this sweet treat.</p>
<p>There’s something inherently special about enjoying ice cream after a
walk in the sun. The contrast between the heat of the day and the coolness
of the ice cream creates a moment of blissful relief. It’s a simple pleasure
that reminds us to slow down and savor the little things in life. Whether
it’s a family outing, a romantic date, or a solo escape, eating ice cream
in a park or garden is a celebration of joy, carefreeness, and the beauty
of nature.</p>
<p>Ice cream is a universal symbol of happiness. It brings out the child
in all of us, inviting us to indulge in moments of pure delight. Whether
enjoyed by kids with sticky fingers or adults reminiscing about their youth,
ice cream has a way of making life a little sweeter. And when savored in
the embrace of nature, it becomes an unforgettable treat that warms the
heart and soul.</p>
