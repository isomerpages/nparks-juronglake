<h3><strong>The Joy and Cherished Memories of Fishing with Dad in Spring Lake</strong></h3>
<p></p>
<p>For Eric Yip, 55, who has lived in Jurong for over five decades, weekends
as a boy were filled with the simple joys of fishing with his father. In
an era devoid of computer games and mobile phones, an outing meant heading
to the small but idyllic Spring Lake, filled with laughter, adventure,
and cherished moments with family and friends.&nbsp;This recreational spot
was popular with many residents, who flocked there for boating, sun-drenched
picnics, and evening strolls.</p>
<p>“During my childhood days, kids spent time in the open, and my father
often took my siblings and me fishing with him on this pond before it was
dammed,” recalls Mr&nbsp; Yip, a father of three, who lives a few blocks
away from the Jurong Lake Gardens.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The memories of those simpler times still resonate deeply. For Mr Yip,
a day out to Spring Lake, now a distant memory for the older generations,
meant more than just fishing; it was a day of connection, not only with
the gentle rhythms of nature but also with his family.&nbsp;"Those were
simple, idyllic days,” he adds, with a tinge of nostalgia.</p>
<p>Pointing to where the pond once was, while taking a break from his mid-day
jog near the Floral Garden in the revitalised Japanese Garden, Mr. Yip
reminisces: “It was at the other end of Jurong, but it was a popular spot
for families, neighbours, and friends to gather, especially on weekends.”</p>
<p>Mr. Yip, who works with a firm managing ATMs, has witnessed Jurong’s rapid
evolution from an uninhabitable mangrove swamp teeming with wildlife, such
as crocodiles, to a bustling urban area.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The transformation of Jurong Lake began after the upper section of the
Jurong River was dammed in 1968, creating a freshwater lake and reservoir,
shaping three islands, one of which became home to the Chinese and Japanese
Gardens. The lake now serves as a reservoir contributing to the country’s
water supply.</p>
<p>The development of the Jurong area started in the 1970s, with estates
such as Boon Lay, Taman Jurong, and Hong Kah forming Jurong West Town.
Under the Jurong West Extension, Pioneer and the surrounding neighborhoods
were also added to the town. The upcoming Jurong Lake District is expected
to transform the area into an attractive location to live, work, and play.</p>
<p>Despite the passage of time and the changes that have transformed Jurong,
Mr Yip's roots remain firmly planted in the soil of his children. “My roots
are in Jurong, and that’s why I have remained in this area all these years,”
he says.</p>
<p>He regularly jogs in the Jurong Lake Gardens, “at least two to three times
a week,” during his lunch break, covering about 2 km as he mostly works
from home. Although he has only been running twice in the revitalised Japanese
and Chinese Gardens since it reopened on Sept&nbsp;9, and has yet to explore
the newer attractions, he finds the gardens impressive and "nicer than
before".</p>
<p>&nbsp;Mr Yip's story is not just a reflection of a changing landscape,
but a reminder of childhood joys and familial love that&nbsp;can be found
in the simplest of pastimes.</p>
