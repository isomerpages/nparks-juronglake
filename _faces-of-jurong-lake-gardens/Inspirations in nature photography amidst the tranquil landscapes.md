<h1><strong>Inspirations in nature photography amidst the tranquil landscapes</strong></h1>
<p></p>
<p>While her friends gather at parks or malls during their days off, Ms.
Olivia Dianso ventures into nature, hiking along trails and exploring gardens
and reserves to seek the company of the feathered kind. Her social media
pages are filled with photos of her birdwatching adventures, featuring
owls, hoopoes, barbets, sunbirds, kingfishers, herons, woodpeckers, and
more. Each photograph belies the long hours spent observing and waiting,
captured through her long lens.</p>
<p>Dressed in a long-sleeved plaid blouse over a gray t-shirt, dark blue
jeans, and comfortable walking shoes topped with a peak cap, Olivia was
spotted at the Jurong Lake Gardens’ Grasslands, one of her frequent birding
spots. There, she set up her camera with a long zoom lens mounted on a
tall tripod stand amidst a field of tall, swaying grasses in the late afternoon.
A trolley bag filled with other lenses, water bottles, and snacks stood
next to her.</p>
<p>Spanning 3.5 hectares, the Grassland at Lakeside Garden is part of an
intertidal habitat that transitions from dry grassland inland to wet grassland
by Jurong Lake. A 300-metre boardwalk meanders along the shoreline, offering
a serene view. The grasslands provide a refuge for both migratory and indigenous
birds.</p>
<p>Jurong Lake Gardens is home to a rich diversity of over 170 bird species,
including urban birds, kingfishers, raptors, waterbirds, and woodpeckers,
each playing vital ecological roles as predators, pollinators, and seed
dispersers.</p>
<p>At the Grasslands, there are three hides strategically placed for observing
birds in their natural habitat. Here, visitors can capture Instagram-worthy
moments featuring the iconic Lone Tree or a picturesque view from atop
the grass mounds.</p>
<p>Olivia, in her 50s, hails from Baguio on Luzon Island in the Philippines,
and has worked nearly three decades as a domestic helper in Singapore.
Although she is single, she proudly mentions her many nephews and nieces.</p>
<p>Olivia’s love for photography initially focused on portraits and landscapes
since 2015. When the Covid pandemic hit, she became interested in birding,
a passion that has taken her to popular birdwatching havens like Sungei
Buloh Wetlands Reserve, MacRitchie Reservoir, Mandai Bird Paradise, Gardens
by the Bay, Jurong Lake Gardens, and Dairy Farm Nature Park.</p>
<p>Olivia says birding is a rewarding journey that combines patience, observation,
and a love for nature. She started by learning to identify common bird
species, paying close attention to their colors, shapes, sizes, and behaviors.
Today, she can spot five of the nine kingfisher species found in Singapore,
including the commonly seen collared and white-throated kingfishers.</p>

of birds all contribute to the experience</p>

<p>Asked what qualities make a good birder, Olivia lists “practice, patience,
and observation.” She emphasises spending time in different habitats, noting,
“The more you observe, the better you’ll get at identifying birds by sight
and sound."</p>
<p>What makes birdwatching interesting?</p>
<p>“The stunning colours, varied plumage patterns, unique antics, and melodies
of birds all contribute to the experience,” she replies. Immersing herself
in nature has deepened her understanding of the ecosystems they inhabit,
she adds.</p>
<p>“Birdwatching is a healthy activity. It helps you connect with nature
and fosters an appreciation for wildlife and the environment,” Olivia explains.
“Being in natural settings and focusing on observing birds can be a calming
and meditative experience… it brings a sense of tranquility and peace,
and helps reduce stress and anxiety.”</p>
<p>It’s also a relatively inexpensive hobby. You can simply go on a walk
or trek with friends, all while exploring the great outdoors. All you need
is a good pair of binoculars, comfortable shoes, and, perhaps, a quality
camera lens.</p>
